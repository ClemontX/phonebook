# Contributing to Phonebook

## What should I know before I get started?
Before you start contributing be sure that you have already taken a look at our [Documentation](https://t-systems-mms.github.io/phonebook/). There you can find all things you need to know before work with the project.

### Mandatory stuff
To provide good code quality we are using prettier to format all files the same way. Just make sure that you are using the Plugin [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) in your IDE. You can find our settings [here](https://prettier.io/).
